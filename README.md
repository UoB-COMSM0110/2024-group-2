## ping pong game 
URL: https://openprocessing.org/sketch/821675

## twist: 
Based on the games aboves, add some attributes of board when game's on, such as: expanding, shrinking, even inertia

## challenge:
how to define the class board and add new features on it

## demovideo:



## Tanks
* Based on the tanks game
* Two player vs or single player vs AI
* Earn money for damging your opponent
* opportunity to use earnings for upgrades between levels: buying new weapons or ungrading tank
* Items: fuel, teleport, repair kit
* Move and adjust barrel angle with arrow keys
* Power bar to adjust power, could control with + and - keys

### Potential twists:
* Shot clock to add time pressure
* Map shuffle, i.e., option to randomly change the terrain/move the players around the map
* Wind change
* Earn rewards for completing objectives e.g., using certain weapons or winning the level in a certain number of turns
* Online multiplayer. This may be too challenging to implement.

### Challenges;
* Physics of the projectile trajectory
* Implementing damage to terrain
* Endless map generation: maybe random wave form to determine terrain?

## Requirements

### 
* Singler player
* Multiplayer player
* Markers
* Us as developers

### User stories
* As a single player, I want a fun, challenging game that I can improve at over time .
* As a single player, I would like to be able to set the difficulty level so that as improve I can keep the game interesting by playing against a more challenging AI opponent.
* As multiplayer, I want to be able to play the game with my friends (online)
* As a player, I would like the game to have lots of different maps to keep the game interesting the more I play.
* As a player, I would like to be able to upgrade my tank and weapons as I earn points throughout the game
* As a marker, I want a game that I can learn to play quickly that demonstrate what students have learned during the module
* As developers, we want to create a game that is fun to play and satisfies the assignement requirements.
* (As an online player, I would like to have skill-based matching so that I can player against players online who are of similar ability.)
* As developers we want to engage with players to see what features are most important to them.
