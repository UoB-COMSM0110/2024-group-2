## Tanks
* Based on the tanks game
* Two player vs or single player vs AI
* Earn money for damging your opponent
* opportunity to use earnings for upgrades between levels: buying new weapons or ungrading tank
* Items: fuel, teleport, repair kit
* Move and adjust barrel angle with arrow keys
* Power bar to adjust power, could control with + and - keys

### Potential twists:
* Shot clock to add time pressure
* Map shuffle, i.e., option to randomly change the terrain/move the players around the map
* Wind change
* Earn rewards for completing objectives e.g., using certain weapons or winning the level in a certain number of turns
* Online multiplayer. This may be too challenging to implement.

### Challenges;
* Physics of the projectile trajectory
* Implementing damage to terrain
* Endless map generation: maybe random wave form to determine terrain?
