game idea

prototype: ping pong game : https://openprocessing.org/sketch/821675

twist: modify some attributes of baffle when game's on

challenge:
* the length of baffle will shrink when ping pong ball hits it
* the movement of baffle has inertia which means it won't change its direction immediately
* before game is on, player has three secs to press a certain key as much as possible, which 
can expand the length of baffle
