game idea

## ping pong game 
URL: https://openprocessing.org/sketch/821675

## twist: 
Based on the games aboves, add some attributes of board when game's on, such as: expanding, shrinking, even inertia

## challenge:
how to define the class board and add new features on it


## Tanks
* Based on the tanks game
* Two player vs or single player vs AI
* Earn money for damging your opponent
* opportunity to use earnings for upgrades between levels: buying new weapons or ungrading tank
* Items: fuel, teleport, repair kit
* Move and adjust barrel angle with arrow keys
* Power bar to adjust power, could control with + and - keys

### Potential twists:
* Shot clock to add time pressure
* Map shuffle, i.e., option to randomly change the terrain/move the players around the map
* Wind change
* Earn rewards for completing objectives e.g., using certain weapons or winning the level in a certain number of turns
* Online multiplayer. This may be too challenging to implement.

### Challenges;
* Physics of the projectile trajectory
* Implementing damage to terrain
* Endless map generation: maybe random wave form to determine terrain?

## Requirements

### 
* Singler player
* Multiplayer player
* Markers
* Us as developers

### User stories
* As a single player, I want a fun, challenging game that I can improve at over time .
* As a single player, I would like to be able to set the difficulty level so that as improve I can keep the game interesting by playing against a more challenging AI opponent.
* As multiplayer, I want to be able to play the game with my friends (online)
* As a player, I would like the game to have lots of different maps to keep the game interesting the more I play.
* As a player, I would like to be able to upgrade my tank and weapons as I earn points throughout the game
* As a marker, I want a game that I can learn to play quickly that demonstrate what students have learned during the module
* As developers, we want to create a game that is fun to play and satisfies the assignement requirements.
* (As an online player, I would like to have skill-based matching so that I can player against players online who are of similar ability.)
* As developers we want to engage with players to see what features are most important to them.

## Design

### Class diagram

This [class diagram](https://github.com/UoB-COMSM0110/2024-group-2/blob/main/.github/images/Tanks_Class_Diagram.png) represents the final implementation of our game. For simplicity, the getting and setting methods for the majority of private class attributes have not been shown. In retrospect, we could have made more use of inheritance to simplify the codebase. More specifically, the design could be improved by having an abstract GameScreen class from which the Shop, GameOver, and GameStart classes inherit, as these classes share common functionality with very similar implementations of button drawing and detection of button pressing. This highlights the importance of investing time in designing a software system upfront, before beginning to implement it. This is particularly evident for a project in which several members of the team are developing features concurrently, as duplication of effort for similar features can happen which would likely have been avoided by a single developer. However, it is often difficult to fully anticipate all design considerations upfront. As we adopted an agile approach to development for this project, we decided to prioritise producing a minimum viable product early in the development cycle over investing more time in considering the design of the software system.
